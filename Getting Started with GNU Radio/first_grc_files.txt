In this directory, you can find some examples to help you understand how GNU Radio works. These examples,
along with others, can be found at: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Tutorials
When you save and run the examples in GNU Radio, they generate two files: one with the .grc extension and
another with the .py extension.

I hope these examples help you take your first steps with this software.
